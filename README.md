Knockout server side validation

knockout-server-side-validation is simple Javascript library for displaying server side errors in browser where elements are bounded to knockout view model. By default, each message from server is shown next to the element error belongs to. This behavior can be overridden. At this moment, this library enables you very simple integration with ASP.NET MVC server side validation, but if needed, it can be extended to use with some another framework.

knockout-server-side-validation has two dependencies: knockoutjs and jQuery.
